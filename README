Usage:

Input parameters:
-Matrix containing all the data. Each row contains the measurements associated to one individual. Each column contains the measurements (Behavior/Imaging/...).
-Groups the data belongs to. Use a sequence of integers. This is used to plot the data a colors and shape per group.
-Groups used to normalize the data. Use a sequence of integers. One may want to normalize their data per group, or the entire dataset.
-Last column index of the image measurements in the data matrix. The behavior measurements are in the following columns.
-Number of permutations to use for the permutation test (this number is also used to set the number of sampling for the bootstrap)
-Names of the measurements
